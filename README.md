# Reading The Rust Programming Language

Notes and projects related to reading the book The Rust Programming Language, by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols.

Reading an [online html version](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). This online version should be more or less the same as [this version](https://nostarch.com/Rust2018), sold by No Starch Press.

Have now also got the paper back of the 2018 edition of this book.
