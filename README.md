# Reading The Rust Programming Language

Notes and projects related to reading the book The Rust Programming Language, by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols.

Reading an [e-book version bought from Google Books](https://books.google.se/books?id=a8l9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_book_other_versions) there is also a free [online html version](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The content in both these versions should, according to my understanding, be similar.
